- 👋 Hi, I’m @fireman365
- 👀 I’m interested in learning and trying to keep current with computers and technology.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about raspberry pi's, and networking.
- 💞️ Please be patient with me, I have been learning about computers and electronics since I bought my first computer in my 20's, it was a Packard Bell 286 - 12 mhz processor, 1 mb ram, 40 mb HD, running dos. Thats how old I am. I have been using computers and learning for several decades but I am still very much a noob. I have a difficult time memorizing commands and other things due to head injuries and age, but I keep trying.
